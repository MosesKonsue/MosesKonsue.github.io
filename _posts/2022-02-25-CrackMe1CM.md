In the interest of developing some reverse engineering skill we're going to start doing challenges from [crackmes](https://crackmes.one). This one is a 1/6 (easy) difficulty rating, Java challenge. It can be found [here.](https://crackmes.one/crackme/5f0c333633c5d42a7c6679b1)

>*"An extremely simple crackme for beginners! Ok, so there's simply just a 4-digit key that you must figure out in order to unlock the program. But, if you have some reverse engineering skills it should be pretty easy to unlock the program without a key ;)"*

We'll be using Ghidra for this one, and be reading from [class.malware.re](https://class.malware.re/2020/04/10/java-analysis-intro.html) heavily. 

Let's go!

After we download and unzip the challenge with the password `crackmes.one` we look at what the `.zip` contained.

We can have a quick look at the `bat` file straight away:

<img src="/assets/images/crackme1/cmo1.PNG" alt="Bat file, figures.">

Let's try running it and see what we get:

<img src="/assets/images/crackme1/cmo2.PNG" alt="Input a number huh.">
<img src="/assets/images/crackme1/cmo3.PNG" alt="Input a number huh.">

For some reason it asks for an 8-digit code, lets see what we can find inside the application. We input a random number and it just closes the window without a message if it's the wrong code after any key press it seems. It's time to load it into Ghidra. 

<img src="/assets/images/crackme1/cmo4.PNG" alt="Drag and drop.">

We see that Ghidra tells us that it's a nested file, I believe this means we should do a `Batch` import.

<img src="/assets/images/crackme1/cmo5.PNG" alt="Definitely nested.">

We see the `.jar` separated into sub-folders to mirror the layout of the application inside the `.jar`.

<h4>Why the Batch option?</h4>

According to the class.malware.re page I mentioned earlier:

The option `Single file` will force Ghidra to import it as a binary without unpacking the archive. (a JAR file is a Java ARchive btw. I did not know this). `Filesystem` will *"display a dialog displaying the file names contained within the archive and its embedded folders as a file-picker. This allows you to pick and choose what components you want to import into Ghidra."*

>*"the Batch choice is what will be used for ex3app.jar, and it will pass you over to a Batch Import window that displays some summary statistics about the contents of the archive to you, and gives you the control to pick and choose what is imported based upon following or ignoring anything matching certain criteria."*

From here we double click to instruct Ghidra to analyse the `.jar` file, we click yes and ok through the default prompts and we can see the contents of the `.jar` file.

From here we look at the functions that the `.jar` file is comprised of and click through them, reading what we can from the `Decompile` window on the right.

<img src="/assets/images/crackme1/cmo7.PNG" alt="Different functions.">

We're looking for a hard-coded 4(?) digit code or some function that will generate one that is the "correct" answer. And in the `bzoLCpGWzMFbU_void` function it seems we find what we are looking for:

<img src="/assets/images/crackme1/cmo8.PNG" alt="!!!">

`0x1488` is the integer stored as variable `pIVar1` as labelled by Ghidra. We do a quick conversion to Decimal:

<img src="/assets/images/crackme1/cmo9.PNG" alt="Conversion.">

Then type it into the application:

<img src="/assets/images/crackme1/cmo10.PNG" alt="Only 4?">

Seems like it's correct! Not sure about the 8-digit thing... But the other comments seem to suggest that it is the final answer.

<h4>For next time:</h4>

- Understand what the various components of Ghidra I am looking at are. The worst one is architecture and Endianness.
- Learn how to see where memory is pointing and how it is moved around. 
- There is more than one way to decompile `.jar` applications, try and mess around with things like JAva Decompiler (JAD)
