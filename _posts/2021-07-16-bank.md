<h2> Enumeration</h2>
**Nmap scan results:**

```
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
53/tcp open  domain  syn-ack ttl 63 ISC BIND 9.9.5-3ubuntu0.14 (Ubuntu Linux)
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu))
```

<h4>What is the scan telling us?</h4>
- 22
- 53
- 80

**Gobuster:**
doesn't seem to return anything noteworthy.

**OWASP-ZAP:**
Nothing of note

Port 53 is a common one that I know I should know about, but I don't know anuthing about. It seems to be the port for the DNS server. It's a virtual host because it's on the same IP.

Looking at the official walkthrough it seems that we should be "guessing" the hostname? Watching ippsec he uses a tool called nslookup which seems to be a dns lookup website.
Assigning the server as 10.10.10.29 and checking 127.0.0.1 we see the name "localhost" which makes sense.
Reverse lookups are not enables so we get nothing from 10.10.10.29 lookup.
In the end he also just types bank.htb which reveals the hostname.

dnsrecon can also be used to enumerate all ip within 10.10.10.29. Doing so reveals no extra hostnames.

testing for AXFR with "dig AXFR bank.htb @10.10.10.29" reveals zone transfer is enabled. Looking at wikipedia this seems to be a way for admins to replicate a dns database across multiple servers. 

```bash
dig AXFR bank.htb @10.10.10.29

; <<>> DiG 9.16.15-Debian <<>> AXFR bank.htb @10.10.10.29
;; global options: +cmd

www.bank.htb.           604800  IN      CNAME   bank.htb.
bank.htb.               604800  IN      SOA     bank.htb. chris.bank.htb. 5 604800 86400 2419200 604800

```

Running the dig command reveals subdomains chris.bank.htb, www.bank.htb, ns.bank.htb. To access these we modify our /etc/resolv.conf and include nameserver 10.10.10.29 at the top of the list.

accessing bank.htb we see a login page, putting this through intercept still leads to the apache page annoyingly. Modifying the header at Host: to bank.htb allows us to access the login page through burp repeater. Doing this we see code 302 http redirect code with more code underneath.

SQLMAP:
Nothing of note

Dirbuster: of bank.htb with medium lowercase wordlist shows
balance-transfer/
support.php
logout.php

<h2>Foothold</h2>

I am way out of my depth with this one so following along with ippsec throughout. In an alternative method he seems to replace the 302 in the header to 200 OK with match and replace in burpsuite. Then navigating to support.php we don't get redirected to the login page due to modifying the 302 to 200 in the header. From here we upload a reverse php shell.
Also the REGEX (LEARN REGEX PLEASE FUTURE ME) experession that modifies is "30[12] FOUND" to signify replacing either 301 or 302.

In the original method he navigates to balance-transfer/ and finds the file that is not ~500 bytes like the others. it contains the credentials for the chris user we found through AXFR earlier.
This allows us to login as chris on the original login page. We can now upload to support from here.

Both methods are different ways of doing the same thing. 

The shell we upload has to be in an image format, so ippsec uploads a gif and then modifies the metadata contents in burp.

The official walkthrough says that a comment on the support.php page says any file uploaded as .htb is executed as .php

once the shell is submitted and the attachment is opened we have our reverse shell. This is upgraded and we enum to find user flag.

<h2>Privilege Escalation</h2>

wget linenum.sh into /dev/sh and running "bash linenum.sh" we see that like the tag suggests there is an interesting SUID in /var/htb/bin/emergency 
running this gives us root and we can find the flags at home/chris/user.txtâ€‹ and/root/root.txt
