Cap was at the time of completion an active box on the HacktheBox platform. It is easy rated and it can be found [here.](https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/Cap)

Initial impression, seems to be pcap based. May have to analyse pcap files in order to find vulnerability. There is a lot of network information here, including information that my VM is connecting to the box.

<h2> Enumeration</h2>
**Nmap scan results:**

```
21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack vsftpd 3.0.3
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack gunicorn
```

<h4>What is the scan telling us?</h4>

- Port 21 is open running ftp, specifically vsftp 3.0.3
- Port 22 is open running ssh, OpenSSH 8.2p1 on Ubuntu.
- Port 80 is running a webserver using gunicorn, which is a Python Webserver Gateway Interface.

Navigating to the website we seem to be logged in as "Nathan" which could be a future credential.

Page source also mentions Ratul Hamba and Rashed, but not much else.
There is a search bar that could possibly be an avenue for attack.

Navigating to `http://10.10.10.245/data/4` we see that there are packets that have been detected and captured by the website. 

I notice that every time I interact with the site/server by scanning or browsing it increments the number on the end of the /data/ url like so: `data/x`. 
We see an option to download these packet captures and we do so from `/data/0` to `/data/4`.

<h2>Foothold</h2>

The `/data/x` files seem to be in order of time, `data/4` is a pcap file containing my interaction with the box, so `data/0` appears to be a pcap of another interaction. 

Perhaps Wireshark can be used to find an ssh key or ftp password.

We begin by using Wireshark to follow the streams of pcap 0: 

<img src="/assets/images/capHTB/Cap3.PNG" alt="We find mention of a password.">

We see on the ftp port that user "nathan" used the password `Buck3tH4TF0RM3!` 

We try logging in on ftp as nathan with those credentials and are successful, and on the ftp server we see `user.txt` for the userflag immediately.


<h2>Privilege Escalation</h2>

Trying to find alternate avenues in, we test and find out that the credentials for ftp were reused for ssh.

From here I host a python server and wget linpeas from my machine to the box. After running linpeas, we see some capabilities highlighted as vectors of privilege escalation. One in particular that is interesting is:

```bash                                                                                                                                                              
Files with capabilities (limited to 50):
/usr/bin/python3.8 = cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip
```
`cap_setuid` is utilized by Python3.8 .

Googling these 2 things in combination leads to this [blog](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/linux-capabilities) which says that:

> *"If python has this capability, you can very easily abuse it to escalate privileges to root. cap_setuid allow changing of the UID (set UID of root in you process)*"

The commands are the following:

```python
import os
os.setuid(0)
os.system("/bin/bash")
```

We make a python script with those commands inside on the box and run it with python 3.8. This gives us root immediately. We find the root flag at /root/root.txt

<h2>What are capabilities?</h2>

The PrivEsc in this box was based around capabilities. What are they and why did they give us root? 
According to [hackingarticles:](https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-capabilities/)

>*"Capabilities work by breaking the actions normally reserved for root down into smaller portions. The use of capabilities is only beginning to drop into userland applications as most system utilities do not shed their root privileges. Letâ€™s move ahead that how we can use this permission more into our task."*

In this case it seems that python3.8 was given the ability to run as root for users by `cap_setuid`:

>*"admin has upraised the privilege by using cap_setuid which means all privilege is assigned to the user for that program"*

So if we run a Python3.8 script that opens a bash shell for example as we did above, we would obtain a root shell. Thereby escalating our privileges.  

<h4>For next time:</h4>

- Remember that ftp and ssh credentials are sometimes reused
- Learn more priv esc, the CAPabilities are a form of escalation I hadn't encountered before.
