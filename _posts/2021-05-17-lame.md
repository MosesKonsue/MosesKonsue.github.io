<h2> Enumeration</h2>
nmap:

```
21/tcp   open  ftp         syn-ack ttl 63 vsftpd 2.3.4
22/tcp   open  ssh         syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn syn-ack ttl 63 Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp  open  netbios-ssn syn-ack ttl 63 Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
3632/tcp open  distccd     syn-ack ttl 63 distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4))
```
<h4>What is the scan telling us?</h4>
- Port 21/tcp is open, and running File Transfer Protocol (ftp) service. Specifically vsftp 2.3.4 which is "an FTP server for Unix-like systems"
- Netbios-ssn which stands for Network Basic Input/Output System Session service. It seems samba is running ontop of netbio-ssn in the form of an smbd â€” server to provide SMB/Common Internet File System(CIFS) services, basically filesharing. smbd is running on top of Netbios because Netbios is simply the transfer layer that allows local networking. Samba is a re-implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) networking protocol.
- distccd = distributed C/C++ compiler server, according to https://linux.die.net/man/1/distccd: distccd is the server for the distcc(1) distributed compiler. It accepts and runs compilation jobs for network clients.  
- Since we don't see a webserver there's no need to run dirbuster or tools such as nikto. 


anon login as ftp is successful but no files are contained inside the directory.

Smba anon login only allows access to /tmp, there doesn't seem to be anything interesting in it

looking at searchsploit for samba 3.0 shows Samba 3.0.20 < 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username' map script' Command Execution (Metasploit)
<h2>foothold</h2>
Which means we're firing up metasploit.

exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script is the one we're using/

this immediately provides root and we enumerate for user and root .txt



For next time:
- Modify nmap scan parameters to include detection of anonymous login possibility.
- Using searchsploit, browsing exploitdb, or simply googling each service port open can reveal vulnerabilities.
