CC:Ghidra is a crash course on the reverse engineering tool Ghidra. Find it [here.](https://tryhackme.com/room/ccghidra)

After the introductory parts of explaining Ghidra, installation process and how to open files for analysis, there are questions based on provided examples. I have barely touched Assembly and know little about reverse engineering. I will be jotting my thoughts on the answers, they may be erroneous assumptions. It will be fun to reflect back on this post once I understand more!

<h2>Questions</h2>

<h4>How many user created functions(including main) are there?</h4>

When looking through the symbol tree on the Ghidra window we see a variety of functions present. However according to the earlier information the functions starting with `_` are functions created during compilation. We see 2 user created functions including main:

<h4>What is the first variable set to in the main function?</h4>

We see in the main function that the first variable is set to `0x10`. THM looks for an answer of `10`.

<h4>What is the first variable set to, in the function "fn1"?</h4>

When looking at the assembly for the fn1 function we can see that `s_hello_00102004` is the first thing stored in RAX:

This translates to `hello` which is the answer THM accepts. 

<h4>If you provide the input "1", when you run the binary, what would the output be?</h4>

We check the decompile window of Ghidra under the `main` function and see something I can read:

It seems variables `int iVar1` and `char *local_18` are first declared. Then the c library [function](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_fgets.htm) `fgets()` reads a line from the standard input stream, maximum 5 characters and stores the string in the `local18` char array. 

Integer variable `iVar1` is then set = to the return of the `strcmp` function. The `strcmp` [function](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strcmp/) compares the values of `local18` to `1\n` or just `1`. According to the cplusplus reference, it is compared in the following way:

In this case, if the value we provide the binary is `1`. Then `1` is compared to `1`, and since the content of both strings is equal the returned value is `0`. Then `if (iVar1 == 0)` which we know it does, print `nice!`. Which is what the output would be if we provided `1`.


<h4>What outputs the good job message?</h4>

We are then given a new binary `a.out`, and find what input results in the output of `good job`.

In a similar fashion to the previous example binary, inputting `goodjob` gives us the desired output!
