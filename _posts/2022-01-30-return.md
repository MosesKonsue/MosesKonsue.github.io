I haven't posted one of these for a while, this is definitely due to the fact that I am now employed!

Anyway. 

Return is an easy rated windows box on the HacktheBox platform. It can be found [here.](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Return/)

>*"Return is an easy difficulty Windows machine featuring a network printer administration panel that stores LDAP credentials. These credentials can be captured by inputting a malicious LDAP server which allows obtaining foothold on the server through the WinRM service. User found to be part of a privilege group which further exploited to gain system access."*

<h2> Enumeration</h2>
**Nmap scan results:**

```

<h4>What is the scan telling us?</h4>

- We see a web server open on the usual port 80.
- Port 53 is an open DNS server.
- We see the Kerberos protocol running on port 88, indicating that there is a Microsoft Active Directory directory service on this box. 
- Netbios protocol on port 139.
- ldap service is running on port 389. [Which is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) *The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol network*
- Port 445 says "microsoft-ds". According to microsoft [technet:](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/581954f6-4c6e-4904-8c23-123aad386477/constant-traffic-on-port-445-microsoftds?forum=winservergen) "AD DC uses port 445 for Replication, User and Computer Authentication, Group Policy, Trusts." According to Microsoft documentation it is also used for: "SMB,CIFS,SMB2, DFSN, LSARPC, NbtSS, NetLogonR, SamR, SrvSvc"
- On port 464, kpasswd5 refers to Kerberos password change service. This port is where password changes for the domain controller are routed. 
- Port 593 is communicating RPC EPMAP over http. *"The DCE/RPC is a specification for a remote procedure call mechanism that defines both APIs and an over-the-network protocol. A DCE/RPC server's endpoint mapper (EPMAP) will listen for incoming calls. A client will call this endpoint mapper and ask for a specific interface, which will be accessed on a different connection."*
- Port 663 is communicating LDAP over SSL protocol for for sending information securely. In this case specifically using SSL to secure communication between LDAP clients and LDAP servers.
- Port 3268 and 3269 have LDAP connection to Global Catalog services running without and with ssl respectively. A [Global catalog](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25429/global-catalog-gc) is: 

>*"A global catalog is a multi-domain catalog that allows for faster searching of objects without the need for a domain name. It helps in locating an object from any domain by using its partial, read-only replica stored in a domain controller. As it uses only partial information and a set of attributes that are most commonly used for searching, the objects from all domains, even in a large forest, can be represented by a single database of a global catalog server."*

- [wsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Management) running on port 5985 is: *"Web services-Management, a DMTF open standard defining a SOAP-based protocol for the management of servers, devices, applications and various Web services. WS-Management provides a common way for systems to access and exchange management information across the IT infrastructure"*
- Port 9389 is running [Active Directory Web Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/services-hub/health/remediation-steps-ad/configure-the-active-directory-web-services-adws-to-start-automatically-on-all-servers), "which provides a Web Service interface to instances of the directory service that are running locally. If the service is stopped or disabled, client applications, such as Active Directory PowerShell, will not be able to access or manage any directory service instances that are running locally on the server."
- WinRM on port 47001 is [Windows remote Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal). *" the Microsoft implementation of WS-Management Protocol, a standard Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based, firewall-friendly protocol that allows hardware and operating systems, from different vendors, to interoperate."*

<h2>Foothold</h2>

Since I've never worked on a Active Directory box before, the official writeup is acting as a study guide. But first we navigate to the website on port 80 and have a look around. 

<img src="/assets/images/return/return1.PNG" alt="What we see on the website.">

The only other page that seems to be accessible is the settings page, gobuster confirms no other interesting directories. 

<img src="/assets/images/return/return2.PNG" alt="The settings page.">

Apparently this is common appearance and settings for a printer admin panel. According to the walkthrough, printers store LDAP and SMB credentials to query the user list from AD and to save scanned files to user drives. We see in the settings panel that we can specify a *"Server Address"* to point at. So this means we can setup a listener on port 389 and put the Server address as our tun0 IP. This will have the printer attempt to authenticate to our "ldap" server, which will result in cleartext credentials. 

<img src="/assets/images/return/return3.PNG" alt="What we hear.">

We see the printer's name and password, and from here we can abuse the open port 5985 which is WinRM(windows remote management) with a [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) shell to gain execution on the printer.

<img src="/assets/images/return/return4.PNG" alt="We're in.">  

<h2>Privilege Escalation</h2>

From here we do the classics, determine what the account we have execution on is allowed to do. We use `net user svc-printer` to find this out on windows.

<img src="/assets/images/return/return5.PNG" alt="Server Operators group.">  

Apparently according to the walkthrough the *"Server Operators"* group is an important one. According to [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#bkmk-serveroperators) these users can administer domain controllers, start stop services, format drives etc. Basically accounts with this privilege are powerful.

From here we can upload netcat to the box with the `upload /path/to/nc.exe` command. Then use [sc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/controlling-a-service-using-sc) which is a command-line utility that can be used to control a service. In this case we use it with `sc.exe config vss` which modifies the value of a service's entries in the registry and in the Service Control Manager database to make a service called `vss`. This service will open nc.exe and spawn a cmd shell that connects to a listener we setup locally. 

<img src="/assets/images/return/return6.PNG" alt="whoami">  

From here we have a system shell, and find the flags on the `svc-printer` and `administrator` desktops.

<h4>For next time:</h4>

- Really gotta read and understand these open AD ports, as well as the finer details of AD and Kerberos.
- Hope that I can do more of these more often.
